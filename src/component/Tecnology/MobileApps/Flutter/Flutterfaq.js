                  The time it takes to develop a Flutter application depends on
                  several factors, such as the complexity of the app, the number
                  of features, the design requirements, and the platform
                  specifications. Generally, a simple app with basic features
                  can take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks to develop, while a more
                  complex app with advanced functionality and custom features
                  could take 2 to 6 months or longer. At Magbyte, we provide a
                  more accurate timeline based on your specific project scope.
                  After discussing your requirements and understanding the
                  details, we can give you a clear estimate of how long it will
                  take to complete your Flutter app.

                  The cost of Flutter app development depends on factors such as
                  the app's complexity, the features required, the developer's
                  experience, and the development team's location. Typically,
                  the cost can range from $5,000 to $50,000 or more. A basic app
                  with limited features will cost less, while more complex apps
                  with advanced functionality and integrations will have a
                  higher price tag. At Magbyte, we provide a detailed project
                  estimate upfront, so you know exactly what to expect. We
                  ensure transparency throughout the process, so there are no
                  hidden costs. Additional expenses may arise if you require
                  extra features, ongoing maintenance, or if the project scope
                  changes during development. However, we work with you to keep
                  costs within your budget while delivering a high-quality
                  Flutter app.
