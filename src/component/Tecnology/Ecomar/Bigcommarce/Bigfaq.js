                The time required to develop a BigCommerce website depends on
                the complexity and scope of your project. On average, a standard
                BigCommerce store can take anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks to
                develop, including design, customization, and testing. More
                complex stores with custom features, integrations, and advanced
                functionality may take longer. At Magbyte, we work closely with
                you to establish a clear timeline based on your specific
                requirements and ensure timely delivery without compromising on
                quality.

                The cost of BigCommerce website development can vary depending
                on factors like design complexity, custom features,
                integrations, and the overall scope of the project. On average,
                a basic BigCommerce store can cost anywhere from $2,000 to
                $10,000, while more complex projects with advanced features can
                go higher. At Magbyte, we provide transparent pricing with no
                hidden fees. We offer a detailed quote based on your
